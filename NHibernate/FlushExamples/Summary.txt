************************************ Without transaction **************************************************************
If we open session and do not open a transaction then DML statements are applied when session.Flush() is called.
In that case if we don't call flash explicitly database state won't change.

************************************ With transaction *****************************************************************
When we use transactions we are expected to use transaction.Commit() to apply our statements to database. If we don't
commit transaction our changes would be rolled back. 
When we use a transaction and call session.Flush() or query all entities including modified, DML statements are sended 
to database side, but they will be applied within a transaction (and won't affect on current DB state).
